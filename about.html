                    <h2>How do you work with people?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="therapy"> 
                    <p>I was drawn to the realm of Counselling and Psychotherapy because of direct experience
                        with its impacts. It was compassionate and insightful Counselling and Psychotherapy that
                        proved to be the deep healing mechanism that enabled and guided my healing and growth,
                        and I have been both curious and committed to the field ever since. <br><br>

                    My main gift is in creating a space of unconditional acceptance and regard for you, that is
                        premised on fundamental trust, which is built on honesty between us. This honesty may be
                        uncomfortable at times, and yet can easily be received because of the compassionate way in
                        which it is delivered and the resonance with which it lands. It is through a collaborative
                        discussion, marked by presence and care, that issues underpinning dysfunction or lostness,
                        sadness or any kind of struggle will be illuminated, repaired and integrated.</p>

                    <p> My experience now is across diverse presentations of pain. I began my career in perinatal
                        mental health and have provided extensive counselling support to women, men and families
                        experiencing post and ante natal depression and adjusting to parenting. I have also worked
                        extensively as a senior clinician in alcohol and other drug and gambling addiction settings.<br><br>
                        I am deeply cognisant that although we are all very different there are themes of pain many
                        of us grapple with over life, and thus it is less the issue presenting that is the focus of
                        healing, but the healing of the human that allows the presenting issue to rest.</p>

                    <p>With practice rooms in Blairgowrie, and also available via Telehealth if either preferred or
                        more practical, I provide counselling and psychotherapy for a range of emotional difficulties
                        and problem behaviours. I work with both individuals and couples. My nature is warm and 
                        empathic; my style is gently curious; my capacity is well tested and has proven over and
                        over again to be helpful.</p>

                    <h2>Why do people come to counselling and therapy?</h2>
                </div>    
                <div class="therapy"> 
                    <p>Psychotherapy and counseling are therapeutic approaches aimed at helping individuals overcome emotional, psychological, and behavioral challenges. They provide a safe and confidential space for clients to explore their thoughts, feelings, and life experiences with the guidance of a trained professional, such as a psychotherapist or counselor.<br><br>

                    Psychotherapy involves in-depth discussions and exploration of the root causes of emotional distress, aiming to gain insight into one's thoughts and behaviors. It utilizes various evidence-based techniques tailored to the individual's needs to promote healing, personal growth, and positive change.</p>
                    
                    <p>Counseling typically focuses on specific issues and challenges faced by clients, such as relationship problems, grief, stress, or career transitions. It can be more short-term and solution-oriented, helping clients develop coping strategies and practical skills to address their immediate concerns.<br><br>
                    
                    Both psychotherapy and counseling can benefit a wide range of individuals. They are valuable resources for those experiencing depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, substance use or addiction, and other mental health disorders. Additionally, they can support individuals dealing with life changes, relationship difficulties, low self-esteem, and personal growth challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>Psychotherapy and counseling can be particularly beneficial for individuals seeking to improve their overall well-being, emotional resilience, and self-awareness. These therapeutic approaches provide a supportive environment for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings, gain new perspectives, and develop healthier coping mechanisms, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.<br><br></p>

                    <h2>What kind of therapy do you practice?</h2>
                </div> 
                <div class="therapy">
                    <p>I am a therapist who practices an integrative approach, drawing from a diverse range of therapeutic modalities to tailor treatment to each individual's unique needs. My approach encompasses neo-analytic techniques that delve into unconscious processes, existential exploration to address questions of meaning and purpose, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for addressing thought patterns and behaviors, and humanistic principles that emphasize personal growth and self-actualization.<br><br>
                        I also incorporate person-centered methods to create a supportive and empathetic therapeutic relationship, as well as transactional analysis to examine interpersonal dynamics.</p>

                    <p>In addition, I utilize systems theory to understand how individuals operate within their broader social contexts, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to help clients embrace their emotions and values. Attachment theory guides my understanding of relationship patterns, while motivational enhancement techniques promote positive change and schema therapy helps to uncover and address long-standing patterns and beliefs.
                    </p>    
                    <p>Overall, my therapeutic approach is trauma informed, comprehensive and adaptable, drawing from these various theories to provide a holistic and effective treatment experience for each individual client.
